		<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I was born in Mexico City, and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Currently, I'm in my senior year at The New School in New York City, where I'm working toward my BBA in Strategic Design and Management at Parsons School of Design while minoring in Journalism+Design at Eugene Lang College.</p>
		<p>I have a strong interest in the future of journalism, specifically in how technology is affecting and radically changing our relationship to information. I have experience in reporting and editing, audience engagement and development, and in the digital aspects vital to media organizations today, including social media management, data journalism, data visualization, and digital design. My academic background is based in design thinking as a methodology, and its applications to business, journalism, art and design.</p>
		<p>I bring to each role that I take on my unique approach to problem solving and collaboration that combines design thinking and strategy with journalistic curiosity and inquiry. All aspects of my life and my work are informed by my multicultural background, my ability to be comfortable with diverse cultural settings and ideologies, and my critical thinking skills.</p> 
		<p>I see the unprecedented changes occurring in our media landscape today as challenges with the potential to ultimately deeply strengthen journalism’s vital role in our society and our democracy. Wherever my career takes me, I look forward to participating in the current media industry shift through my unique set of skills, experiences and perspectives in order to do my part to ensure that great journalism survives and thrives throughout my lifetime and beyond.</p>
